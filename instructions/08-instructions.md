To build software that can interpret audible speech and respond appropriately, you can use the **Speech** cognitive service, which provides a simple way to transcribe spoken language into text and vice-versa.

For example, suppose you want to create a smart device that can respond verbally to spoken questions, such as "What time is it?" The response should be the local time. 

To test the capabilities of the Speech service, we'll use a simple command-line application that runs in the Cloud Shell. The same principles and functionality apply in real-world solutions, such as web sites or phone apps.

1. Click the **Activate Sandbox** button at the top of the page. This starts a Cloud Shell instance. 

2. If you are prompted to review permissions, click **Accept**.

## Create a *Speech* resource

Let's start by creating a **Speech** resource in your Azure subscription:

1. In another browser tab, open the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true), signing in with your Microsoft account.
2. Click the **&#65291;Create a resource** button, search for *Speech*, and create a **Speech** resource with the following settings:
    - **Name**: *Enter a unique name*.
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*.
    - **Location**: *Choose any available region*
    - **Pricing tier**: Free F0
    - **Resource group**: *Select an existing resource group or create a new one*.

3. Review and create the resource, and wait for deployment to complete. Then go to the deployed resource.
4. View the **Keys and Endpoint** page for your Speech resource. You will need the **location/region** and **keys** to connect from client applications.

## Configure and run a client application

Now that you have a resource, you can run a simple client application that uses the Speech service.

1. In the command shell, enter the following command to download the sample application and save it to a folder called ai-900.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AI-900-AIFundamentals ai-900
    ```

2. The files are downloaded to a folder named **ai-900**. Now we want to see all of the files in your Cloud Shell storage and work with them. Type the following command into the shell: 

     ```
    code .
    ```

    Notice how this opens up an editor. 

3. In the **Files** pane on the left, expand **ai-900** and select **speaking-clock.ps1**. This file contains some code that uses the Speech service to recognize and synthesize speech:

    ![The editor containing code to use the Speech service](../media/speaking-clock-code.png)

4. Don't worry too much about the details of the code, the important thing is that it needs the region/location and either of the keys for your Speech resource. Copy these from the **Keys and Endpoints** page for your resource from the Azure portal and paste them into the code editor, replacing the **YOUR_LOCATION** and **YOUR_KEY** placeholder values respectively.

5. At the top right of the editor pane, use the **...** button to open the menu and select **Save** to save your changes. Then open the menu again and select **Close Editor**.

    The sample client application will use your Speech service to transcribe spoken input and synthesize an appropriate spoken response. A real application would accept the input from a microphone and send the response to a speaker, but in this simple example, we'll use pre-recorded input in a file and save the response as another file.

    Use the video player below to hear the input audio the application will process:

6. In the PowerShell pane, enter the following command to run the code:

    ```
    cd ai-900
    ./speaking-clock.ps1
    ```

7. Review the output, which should have successfully recognized the text "What time is it?" and saved an appropriate response in a file named *output.wav*.

    Use the following video player to hear the spoken output generated by the application:

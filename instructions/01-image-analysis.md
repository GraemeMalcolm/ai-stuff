# Analyze an image with the Computer Vision Service

The *Computer Vision* cognitive service uses pre-trained machine learning models to analyze images and extract information about them.

For example, suppose the fictitious retailer *Northwind Traders* has decided to implement a "smart store", in which AI services monitor the store to identify customers requiring assistance, and direct employees to help them. By using the Computer Vision service, images taken by cameras throughout the store can be analyzed to provide meaningful descriptions of what they depict.

## Create a *Computer Vision* resource

Let's start by creating a **Computer Vision** resource in your Azure subscription:

1. In another browser tab, open the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true), signing in with your Microsoft account.
2. Click the **&#65291;Create a resource** button, search for *Computer Vision*, and create a **Computer Vision** resource with the following settings:
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*.
    - **Resource group**: *Select an existing resource group or create a new one*.
    - **Region**: *Choose any available region*
    - **Name**: *Enter a unique name*.
    - **Pricing tier**: Free F0
    - **Responsible AI Notice**: *Scroll down if necessary, and select the checkbox to confirm you have read the notice*.

3. Review and create the resource, and wait for deployment to complete. Then go to the deployed resource.
4. View the **Keys and Endpoint** page for your Computer Vision resource. You will need the endpoint and keys to connect from client applications.

## Create a cloud shell

To test the capabilities of the Computer Vision service, we'll use a simple command-line application that runs in the cloud shell provided with your Azure subscription.

1. In the Azure portal, select the **[>_]** (*Cloud Shell*) button at the top of the page to the left of the search box. This opens a Cloud Shell pane at the bottom of the portal, as shown here.

2. The first time you open the cloud shell, you will be prompted to choose the type of shell you want to use (*Bash* or *PowerShell*). Select **PowerShell**.
3. If you are prompted to create storage for your cloud shell, ensure your subscription is specified and select **Create storage**. Then wait a minute or so for the storage to be created. Eventually, the cloud shell pane will display a command prompt like this:

    > **Note**: If you selected *Bash*, or you had previously opened a Bash cloud shell, you can switch to PowerShell by using the drop-down menu at the top left of the cloud shell pane.

## Configure and run a client application

Now that you have a cloud shell environment, you can run a simple client application that uses the Computer Vision service to analyze an image.

1. In the command shell, enter the following command to download the sample application.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/GraemeMalcolm/ai-stuff
    ```
